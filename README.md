# [Overleaf](https://www.Overleaf.com) Installer for Windows

### This script automates the entire installation of [Overleaf](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf) on Windows.


It should take care of all the requirements for you: 
- Checks for WSL and Docker, and installs them if necessary.
- Offers customizing certain things, and a persistent data folder.
- Offers creation of username and password, and provides a link to create the password.
- Creates a "shortcut" that you can click on to start Overleaf automatically.

In other words, the whole works. I just hope it works for you.


## Quick Start

1. **Download the Installer**: Click [here](https://github.com/sm18lr88/Overleaf_Installer/raw/main/Install_Overleaf.bat).
2. **Run**: Right-click the downloaded file and select "Run as administrator".

## Note on Antivirus

Your antivirus might block this script. If it does:
- Temporarily disable your antivirus, or
- Add an exclusion for `Install_Overleaf.bat` in your antivirus settings.
- After the script is done, you'll also need to add an exclusion for the resulting `Start_Overleaf.bat`.
